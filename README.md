A Learn By Building Project in the "Dynamic Data Profiling Dashboard with Streamlit and Google Sheet" Course by Algoritma.

This dashboard is designed to facilitate data analysis on a videogame dataset. 
It offers a variety of charts and visualizations to help users explore and understand the data. 
The dashboard leverages Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and analysis, 
and uses Streamlit to provide interactive features for an engaging user experience. 
The dataset is dynamically connected via Google Sheets using the st-gsheets-connection package, 
ensuring that the data is always up-to-date and easily accessible.
